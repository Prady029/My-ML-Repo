# My early days of Macine Learning
I have had coded some machine learning algo back in 2018. 
Was nervous that time,being just a beginner.
Now,  thinking of those times, I have a huge banter to share with you all :)

## Here what this jupyter-notebooks contain:
1.my first linear regression
2.my multiple linear regression
3.my lasso regularisation regression
4.elastic net regularisation regression
5.polynomial regression.

## These codes are not generalised,they are just my naive attempts.
